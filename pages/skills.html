	<p>During my free time I enjoy reading action and adventure books, playing video games such as
	Red Dead Redemption 2, Final Fantasy XV, Yakuza series, Assassin Creed series, and GTA. I
	also enjoy listening to music whenever I have the chance, my favorite genres are Hip-Hop, Rock,
	and Metal. Another hobby I have is that I enjoy playing basketball or to skateboard around my neighborhood.</p>

		<p>One of my most favorite sports is basketball. I tend to play basketball with friends after school or whenever we have freetime. Although I am not good at the sport I still try my best. I also skateboard around my neighborhood whenever I get bored at home or to relieve some stress from homework.</p>
