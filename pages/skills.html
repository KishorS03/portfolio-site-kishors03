	<p>During my free time I enjoy reading action and adventure books, playing video games such as
	Red Dead Redemption 2, Final Fantasy XV, Yakuza series, Assassin Creed series, and GTA. I
	also enjoy listening to music whenever I have the chance, my favorite genres are Hip-Hop, Rock,
	and Metal. Another hobby I have is that I enjoy playing basketball or soccer with my friends.</p>
