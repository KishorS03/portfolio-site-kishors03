		<p>The University of Waterloo is considered the number 1 university for mathematics, in order to be accepted in to this program, one must have an average of the low 90s to the high 90s along with credits for English, Advanced Functions, Calculus and Vectors, and three other grade 12 courses. I hope to get into this university due to my interest in porgramming and hope to have a career in this field in the future.</p>
