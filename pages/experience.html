	<p>I learned how to use Photoshop in Grade 7 from a computer course. We had several assignments such as making a real life person into a cartoon picture and many others. I had also done some photoshop in Grade 10 through the Technological course. We had done a series of editing which helped add to my knowledge of techniques for the program.</p>
