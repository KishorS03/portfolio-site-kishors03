<h1>Experience</h1>
	<p>I have experience in several technological fields such as Photoshop, HTML and CSS coding. I have experience with Photoshop through the Technological Design course in Grade 10 and I learned HTML, and CSS coding through my own interest in Grade 7 and 8.</p>

		<p>My first time ever coding was in Grade 7. I had been interested in coding ever since I saw a video of a computer progammer talk about his feats in the coding community. I had learned the basics of coding in Grade 7 and 8, but as time went by I had come to forget most of the coding terms due to not me not learning code continuously. I had also learned some CSS, I had leanred to chage the colour of my text, the background, add images, and to incorporate different layouts.</p>

		<p>I learned how to use Photoshop in Grade 7 from a computer course. We had several assignments such as making a real life person into a cartoon picture and many others. I had also done some photoshop in Grade 10 through the Technological course. We had done a series of editing which helped add to my knowledge of techniques for the program, such as adding layers to create more vibrant images and creating text effects.</p>
